## Overview

Python Patch is a comprehensive library for working with unified diff files. It provides both a command-line interface and a Python API for parsing, analyzing, and applying patches from various version control systems.

## ‚ú® Key Features

### üîß **Robust Parsing & Application**

- **Multi-format support**: Git, Mercurial (HG), Subversion (SVN) patch formats
- **Automatic error correction**: Handles broken diffs, line ending issues, and path prefix problems
- **Smart detection**: Automatically identifies patch format and applies appropriate parsing rules

### üõ†Ô∏è **Developer-Friendly API**

- **Simple API**: Easy-to-use functions for common operations
- **Type hints**: Full type annotation support for better IDE integration
- **Comprehensive error handling**: Detailed error reporting and recovery options

### üéØ **Production Ready**

- **Zero dependencies**: Uses only Python standard library
- **Cross-platform**: Works on Linux, Windows, and macOS
- **High test coverage**: Extensively tested with real-world patch files
- **Performance optimized**: Efficient parsing and memory usage

### üìä **Rich Output**

- **Detailed diffstat**: Visual histogram showing changes per file
- **Progress reporting**: Track application progress for large patch sets
- **Flexible output formats**: JSON, plain text, and structured data

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Current Limitations

The following features are not yet supported:

- File renaming, creation, and removal operations
- Directory tree operations (mkdir, rmdir)
- Version control specific properties and metadata
- Non-unified diff formats (context diffs, ed scripts)

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Installation

Install from PyPI using pip:

```bash
# Install the latest stable version
pip install patch

# Install with development dependencies
pip install "patch[dev]"

# Install specific version (recommended for production)
pip install "patch==1.*"
```

### Basic Usage

=== "Command Line"

    ```bash
    # Apply a patch file
    patch diff.patch
    
    # Apply with custom strip level
    patch --strip=1 changes.patch
    
    # Dry run (show what would be changed)
    patch --dry-run feature.patch
    
    # Reverse a patch
    patch --reverse bugfix.patch
    ```

=== "Python API"

    ```python
    import patch
    
    # Parse and apply a patch file
    patchset = patch.fromfile('changes.patch')
    if patchset:
        success = patchset.apply(strip=1)
        print(f"Applied {len(patchset)} patches successfully: {success}")
    
    # Parse patch from string
    patch_content = """--- a/file.txt
    +++ b/file.txt
    @@ -1,3 +1,3 @@
     line1
    -old line
    +new line
     line3"""
    
    patchset = patch.fromstring(patch_content)
    if patchset:
        patchset.apply()
    ```
